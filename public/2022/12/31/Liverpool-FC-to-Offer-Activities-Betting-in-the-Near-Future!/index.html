<h1 id="Atlantic-City-to-Begin-Offering-Activities-Betting-on-Liverpool-FC-Matches"><a href="#Atlantic-City-to-Begin-Offering-Activities-Betting-on-Liverpool-FC-Matches" class="headerlink" title="Atlantic City to Begin Offering Activities Betting on Liverpool FC Matches!"></a>Atlantic City to Begin Offering Activities Betting on Liverpool FC Matches!</h1><p>Atlantic City, long known for its casinos and gambling, is expanding its offerings to include legalized sports betting on Liverpool Football Club (FC) matches! The city’s casino operators have entered into a partnership with the English Premier League club to offer in-game betting on LFC fixtures.</p>
<p>Atlantic City’s foray into sports betting began in June of 2018 when the US Supreme Court struck down the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA), which had effectively banned such activity outside of Nevada. PASPA’s repeal opened the door for other states to legalize sports betting, and New Jersey was among the first to do so.</p>
<p>Now Atlantic City’s casino operators are hoping that fans of Liverpool FC, one of the world’s most popular football clubs, will visit their venues to place bets on upcoming matches. The agreement between Atlantic City and Liverpool FC is non-exclusive, so fans in other cities where sports betting is legal may also be able to bet on LFC fixtures.</p>
<p>Liverpool FC is one of England’s “big six” clubs, along with Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur, and Everton. The club has won 18 league titles and five European Cups/Champions League trophies, making it one of the most successful clubs in English football history.</p>
<p>The partnership between Atlantic City and Liverpool FC comes as the latter club is preparing for its 2019-2020 season. The Reds finished second in the Premier League last season behind champion Manchester City and will be looking to win their first league title since 1990 this upcoming year. They will also be competing in the UEFA Champions League, Europe’s premier club competition.</p>
<p>So if you’re a fan of Liverpool FC or just enjoy gambling on sporting events, make sure to visit an Atlantic City casino soon!</p>
