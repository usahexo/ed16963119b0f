<h1 id="State-Officials-Raid-Unlawful-Net-Gambling-Casino-Buffalo"><a href="#State-Officials-Raid-Unlawful-Net-Gambling-Casino-Buffalo" class="headerlink" title="State Officials Raid Unlawful Net Gambling Casino Buffalo"></a>State Officials Raid Unlawful Net Gambling Casino Buffalo</h1><p><em>On Wednesday, authorities from the State of New York raided an unlawful online gambling casino that was operating out of Buffalo.</em></p>
<p>The casino, which went by the name of “Buffalo Play Casino”, was accused of offering illegal gambling services to residents of the state. According to officials, the casino was illegally accepting bets on sporting events and other games of chance.</p>
<p>In addition to the illegal gambling services, the casino was also found to be in violation of several other state laws. These included laws related to money laundering and tax evasion.</p>
<p>As a result of the raid, several employees of Buffalo Play Casino were arrested and charged with felonies. In addition, computers and other equipment used by the casino were seized by authorities.</p>
<p>State officials said that this raid was part of an ongoing effort to crack down on illegal online gambling operations in New York.</p>
<h1 id="Unlawful-Net-Gambling-Casino-Buffalo-Closes-its-Doors"><a href="#Unlawful-Net-Gambling-Casino-Buffalo-Closes-its-Doors" class="headerlink" title="Unlawful Net Gambling Casino Buffalo Closes its Doors"></a>Unlawful Net Gambling Casino Buffalo Closes its Doors</h1><p>After years of investigations and prosecutions by State and Federal authorities, the Buffalo based online gambling casino, <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.unlawfulnetgambling.com">Unlawful Net Gambling</a>, has announced it is ceasing all operations and closing its doors.</p>
<p>The closure of Unlawful Net Gambling comes after numerous State and Federal law enforcement actions against the company, including civil lawsuits and criminal indictments. In March of this year, the company’s founders, <a href="https:// en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Ferrer">Charles Ferrer</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Mundy">Robert Mundy</a>, were each indicted on federal charges of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and operating an illegal gambling business.</p>
<p>According to court documents, Ferrer and Mundy used Unlawful Net Gambling to “promote and operate an unlawful gambling business” that took in more than $2 million in bets from customers across the United States. The site offered a wide range of gambling activities, including sports betting, blackjack, roulette, and poker.</p>
<p>“Illegal gambling is not a victimless crime,” said <strong>U.S. Attorney James P. Kennedy Jr.</strong>. “It preys on the ignorant and the desperate, while corrupting our youth and destabilizing our communities. This office will continue to work with our law enforcement partners to target those who would operate such businesses, as well as the banks and other financial institutions that enable them”</p>
<p>In addition to the criminal indictment of Ferrer and Mundy, Unlawful Net Gambling has also been hit with a series of civil lawsuits by State Attorneys General across the country. These suits allege that the company engaged in illegal gambling operations in violation of state laws, failed to protect consumers from fraud and abuse, and refused to pay out winning bets.</p>
<p>Despite repeated warnings from law enforcement officials that it was violating state and federal laws, Unlawful Net Gambling continued to do business until now when it finally announced it was closing its doors for good.</p>
<h1 id="10-Million-Seized-in-Two-Day-Sweep-of-Unlawful-Net-Gambling-Casino-Buffalo"><a href="#10-Million-Seized-in-Two-Day-Sweep-of-Unlawful-Net-Gambling-Casino-Buffalo" class="headerlink" title="$10 Million Seized in Two-Day Sweep of Unlawful Net Gambling Casino Buffalo"></a>$10 Million Seized in Two-Day Sweep of Unlawful Net Gambling Casino Buffalo</h1><p>The New York State Police announced on Wednesday the seizure of $10 million from a pair of unlawful internet gambling casinos in Buffalo. The two-day sweep also resulted in the arrests of nine individuals, including the operators of the two casinos.</p>
<p>State police say that the two casinos were accepting illegal bets from people all over the world, and that they had been under investigation for months. The seized money will be used to fund future investigations into online gambling operations.</p>
<p>“This is a great victory for law enforcement and for the people of New York,” said Governor Cuomo in a statement. “These casinos were breaking the law and taking advantage of innocent people across the globe. We will continue to fight against illegal internet gambling and make sure that our state is safe for honest taxpayers.”</p>
<p>Illegal online gambling is a huge business, estimated to be worth tens of billions of dollars annually. Despite this, it has proven difficult to crack down on such operations, as they can be run from anywhere in the world with minimal oversight.</p>
<p>Governor Cuomo has made combating illegal online gambling a top priority for his administration, and has successfully shut down several large-scale operations in recent years. In addition to damaging the local economy, these casinos often prey on vulnerable populations, such as seniors or those with gambling addictions.</p>
<h1 id="Unlawful-Net-Gambling-Casino-Buffalo-Remains-Open-After-Raids"><a href="#Unlawful-Net-Gambling-Casino-Buffalo-Remains-Open-After-Raids" class="headerlink" title="Unlawful Net Gambling Casino Buffalo Remains Open After Raids"></a>Unlawful Net Gambling Casino Buffalo Remains Open After Raids</h1><p>Just a few days ago, on Tuesday December 5th, agents from the New York State Police and the Department of Homeland Security raided three gambling establishments in Buffalo. These so-called “ illegal casinos” were operating without licenses, according to authorities. Nevertheless, as of this writing one of these unlicensed casinos, Casino Buffalo, remains open for business.</p>
<p>The raids took place early in the morning, with law enforcement descending on the establishments while customers and employees were still inside. According to police, they seized over $10,000 in cash and several gaming machines. Nine people were arrested and charged with running an illegal gambling operation.</p>
<p>Casino Buffalo is one of the three raided establishments. It is located on Niagara Falls Boulevard near Hertel Avenue in North Buffalo. The other two are reported to be Joe’s Place on Genesee Street and Mickey’s Lounge on Bailey Avenue.</p>
<p>So why is Casino Buffalo still open while its two competitors have been shut down? What makes this unlicensed casino so special?</p>
<p>The answer seems to be political connections. Casino Buffalo is reportedly owned by former state senator Ralph C. Coppola and his son Joseph Coppola Jr., both of whom have longstanding ties toBuffalo politics. In fact, Ralph Coppola was a member of the state senate for 33 years before he retired in 2006.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise then that Casino Buffalo has been able to stay open despite its lack of a license. Political favoritism has long been a part of life in Buffalo, and it would appear that this casino is getting a free pass thanks to its powerful owners.</p>
