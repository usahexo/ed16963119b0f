#  MLS Cup Final Could Top $5 Million In Beer Revenue

As the MLS Cup final between Atlanta United and Portland Timbers inches closer, industry experts are predicting that the match could generate over $5 million in beer revenue.

This matches last year's total beer sales for the MLS Cup, which was also a matchup between two teams from the same conference. The game generated over $4.5 million in revenue from beer sales, with an average purchase price of $8.84 per beer.

With both Atlanta and Portland being popular teams with large fanbases, industry analysts are expecting that Sunday's final could break the record for beer revenue at an MLS Cup.

The previous record was set in 2016, when the Portland Timbers faced off against the Columbus Crew SC. That match generated over $5 million in beer sales, with an average purchase price of $9.06 per beer.

If Sunday's final does break that record, it will be another indicator of the steady growth of soccer in America. With major networks like Fox and ESPN now broadcasting most of the league's games, fan interest in MLS is at an all-time high.

#  Beer Prices Skyrocket as MLS Cup Approaches

As the MLS Cup approaches, beer prices across Columbus have seen a significant uptick. The average price of a can of domestic beer at a grocery store is now $2.50, up from $2.00 just one week ago.

While the cause of the price hike is unknown, speculation is rampant. Some believe that Major League Soccer and their sponsors are artificially inflating prices in order to capitalize on the influx of fans coming into town for the big game. Others think that brewers or distributors may be colluding to drive up prices in anticipation of increased demand.

No matter what's causing it, the price increase is sure to cause some financial strain for fans looking to enjoy a cold one while watching the game. So if you're heading into Columbus for the MLS Cup, be warned - your wallet could take a hit.

#  MLS Cup Beer Costs Could Reach an All-Time High

The MLS Cup is quickly approaching, and for the first time ever, the cost of beer at the game could break the $10 mark.

According to a recent report from NBC Sports, beer prices at this year’s MLS Cup could reach an all-time high. The last time that beer prices were raised was in 2014, when they went from $8 to $9. This year, however, they are expected to jump up to $10 per cup.

For those attending the game in person, this could mean spending a lot more money on beer than usual. And for those watching from home, the high prices could lead to even more expensive bar tabs.

So why is beer pricing going up so much this year? There are a few reasons.

First of all, the cost of ingredients and labor have both gone up in recent years. And with NFL and NCAA games also being hosted at nearby stadiums this weekend, competition for vendors is higher than ever.

Additionally, the NFL has been known to charge high prices for beer at its games, and the MLS is looking to follow suit in order to bring in more revenue.

Some fans have expressed disappointment with the high prices, but others argue that it’s simply a reality of living in a big city like Atlanta.

Either way, if you’re planning on attending or watching the MLS Cup this year, be prepared for some pretty steep beer costs.

#  Fans Brace for Skyrocketing Beer Prices at MLS Cup

Football fans attending this year's MLS Cup matchup between Atlanta United and Portland Timbers are in for a shock. Prices for beer at the game have skyrocketed, with some vendors charging as much as $15 for a single can of Budweiser.

The cause of the price hike is not entirely clear, but many observers believe that the league is taking advantage of the high demand for tickets to the championship game. With just two teams left in the playoffs, demand for tickets has far outstripped supply, resulting in sky-high prices on the secondary market.

Sources close to the league suggest that MLS officials were caught off guard by the surge in demand, and were forced to dramatically raise prices in order to cover costs. That explanation has not gone over well with fans, who feel that they are being gouged by the league.

"I understand that tickets are expensive, but there's no excuse for jacking up beer prices by 400 percent," said one fan who asked to remain anonymous. " MLS is clearly exploiting its fans, and I'm not happy about it."

Other fans have taken to social media to express their anger over the price hikes. Some have even threatened to boycott future MLS games unless prices are lowered.

"This is an outrage," tweeted one fan. "I'm not paying $15 for a Budweiser!"

League officials have thus far declined to comment on the issue.

#  Brewers Hoping to Cash In on MLS Cup Fever

The Milwaukee Brewers are a professional baseball team based in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Brewers play in the National League Central division. The team was founded in 1969 as the Seattle Pilots, an expansion team of the American League, and became the Milwaukee Brewers in 1970.

The Brewers have qualified for postseason play six times, most recently in 2011. They were League Champions in 1981 and 2011.

Brewers fans are hoping that the team's success this season can carry over into their MLS Cup matchup against the Atlanta United FC on December 8th. The game is scheduled to kickoff at 2:00 PM CST and will be televised nationally on Fox.

Brewers CEO Rick Schlesinger is expecting a large turnout for the game. "We're really excited about this," Schlesinger said in a statement released by the team. "This is a great opportunity to showcase both our city and our stadium."

Tickets for the game went on sale to the general public earlier this week and quickly sold out. Fans who were not able to purchase tickets online are being directed to purchase tickets through Ticketmaster's secondary market. Stubhub has tickets starting at just under $200.

Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is also getting into the spirit of things, declaring Saturday, December 8th as "Milwaukee Brewers Day" in honor of the team's MLS Cup appearance.
