#  Local Man Wins Mega Jackpot Playing Bingo!

Alan James of Northampton is $5 million richer after winning the Mega Jackpot playing bingo at his local hall!

James, a married father-of-two, said he couldn't believe it when his numbers came up. "It was pure luck. I've been playing bingo for years and never dreamed I'd win such a big prize," he said.

The 59-year-old retiree said he plans to use the money to pay off his mortgage and enjoy a much-needed holiday with his family. "We're all going to go away for a couple of weeks – somewhere hot where we can relax," he said.

James is the fourth person in the UK to win the Mega Jackpot in the past six months. In December 2016, an 82-year-old woman from Leeds won £4 million playing bingo at her local hall.
