# Card Dealer from The Wild Card is Killed in Brazil

The local news outlets in Brazil are reporting that a well-known card dealer from The Wild Card was found dead early this morning. The victim, who has not been identified, is said to have suffered a gunshot wound to the head.

This is the second violent death to occur at The Wild Card in as many months. In late July, a patron was stabbed to death in the casino's popular gaming area.

Police have not released any information about potential suspects in either case.

The Wild Card has been a popular destination for tourists and locals alike since it opened its doors more than two years ago. The casino features a variety of table games and slot machines, as well as a number of restaurants and bars.

#  Ex-Blackjack Dealer from The Wild Card Seen in Brazil

In a recent turn of events, it appears that a former blackjack dealer from the popular TV series "The Wild Card" has been spotted in Brazil. The individual in question is a woman by the name of Natalie Winters, who is believed to have fled to South America in order to evade authorities.

Natalie Winters is wanted by police in connection with a large-scale cheating operation that took place at a casino in Las Vegas. She is alleged to have worked together with several other individuals in order to win millions of dollars worth of casino chips. The scam was only discovered after investigators noticed that large sums of money were being transferred out of the casino's accounts into those of the conspirators.

Unfortunately for Winters, one of her conspirators turned out to be an undercover agent from the FBI, and she was eventually arrested and charged with conspiracy to commit fraud. If found guilty, she could face up to 5 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.

However, it now appears that Winters has managed to flee the country and is believed to be hiding out in Brazil. The FBI has issued an international warrant for her arrest, and they are asking for any information that may lead to her whereabouts.

Winters first came to attention back in 2013 when she appeared as a contestant on "The Wild Card", a TV show which pits aspiring dealers against each other in a series of Blackjack challenges. She ended up winning the contest, and subsequently landed a job as a blackjack dealer at the Tropicana Casino in Las Vegas.

It is not clear how Winters managed to slip away undetected, but it's possible that she may have already had connections in Brazil or elsewhere in South America. In any case, the FBI is urging anyone who may have information about her whereabouts to come forward immediately.

# Card Dealer in The Wild Card Movie Flees to Brazil

In the movie Wild Card, based on the novel by Michael Stackpole, there is a scene where the card dealer, known as "The Creeper", played by actor Corey Johnson, flees to Brazil to escape prosecution for his role in a high-stakes card game.

What is not well known is that Johnson actually did flee to Brazil to avoid prosecution for his role in a real-life high-stakes card game. The game was a $25,000 buy-in Texas Hold'em game that took place at the Bellagio Casino in Las Vegas.

The game was hosted by professional poker player Phil Ivey, who later sued the casino after they refused to pay him his winnings from the game. The casino claimed that Ivey and two of his partners had used cheating methods to win the game.

A judge eventually ruled in Ivey's favor, awarding him over $10 million in damages. It is not clear if Johnson ever paid any of Ivey's damages.

# Card Dealer in The Wild Card Connected to Illegal Gambling Ring in Brazil

On December 5th, authorities in Brazil arrested a card dealer working at a casino in the town of Foz do Iguaçu as part of an illegal gambling ring. The dealer, whose name has not been released to the public, is believed to have been connected to the ring for at least two years.

The illegal gambling ring was centered around roulette and blackjack games that were taking place in clandestine casinos across southern Brazil. In all, 24 people were arrested as part of the raid, including the casino's owner and several other employees.

Investigators believe that the card dealer was responsible for providing cards to the other players in the game, helping to ensure that the games were rigged in favor of the house. In addition to his role as a dealer, it is also believed that he acted as a lookout for police and other authorities who might be investigating the ring.

This is not the first time that an illegal gambling ring has been uncovered in Brazil. In fact, there have been several large-scale investigations in recent years that have resulted in dozens of arrests. However, this is one of the first times that a card dealer has been implicated in such a scheme.

Casino officials are cooperating with investigators and say that they will take appropriate action against the card dealer once he is released from custody.
