If you're new to the game, don't worry - we're here to help. In this article, we will teach you the basics of blackjack so that you can hit the tables with confidence. We'll also cover some tips and strategies to help improve your chances of winning. So what are you waiting for? Let's get started!

# The Basics

Blackjack is a card game that is played between two players and the dealer. The aim of the game is to achieve a total score of 21 or closer to 21 than the dealer without going over. Cards 2-10 are worth face value, kings, queens and jacks are worth 10 each, and an ace can be worth either 1 or 11 depending on what makes the best hand.

The player begins by placing a bet, after which they are given two cards face up. The dealer also receives two cards - one face up and one face down. As each player's turn comes around, they must decide whether to "hit" (draw another card) or "stand" (end their turn). If their total score exceeds 21 (i.e. they bust), they lose automatically regardless of what the dealer does next.

If both the player and dealer have cards totalling 21 (a blackjack), the player wins automatically unless the dealer has a blackjack as well, in which case it's a draw. Note that if you split a pair of Aces (more on this later), each Ace receives just one additional card instead of two - meaning you could potentially bust if you hit them again!

# Betting Limits

Just like any other casino game, blackjack comes with different betting limits depending on where you play. In general though, most casinos will permit players to bet up to $100 per hand - although this can vary depending on the type of table layout being used. As such, it's important to familiarise yourself with the betting limits before sitting down at any table so as not to be caught off guard later on.
