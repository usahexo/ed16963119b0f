#  You Lose Big When a Dozen Doesn't Come Up at Roulette

Unless you're playing at a smaller casino, or one that uses a single-zero wheel, the odds of winning at roulette are about the same as those of being hit by lightning. With a house edge of around 2.7 percent, over the long run you'll lose almost every bet you make.

But there are ways to improve your chances - up to and including outright cheating. And, as with most things in life, when it comes to roulette, size matters.

The more money you risk on any given spin, the more you stand to gain (or lose). But how much should you stake per round?

Mathematicians and gaming experts have long debated this question, with no definitive answer. However, simulations show that if you want to maximise your chances of winning at roulette, you should bet a dozen numbers (chances of which are 1 in 3,375).

This is because the odds of any individual number coming up are slim (1 in 37), but the odds of any two adjacent numbers coming up are much higher (1 in 18). So, if you spread your bets across 12 different numbers - six on either side of the zero - your chances of winning increase dramatically.

Of course, this also means that your potential payout is lower than if you place single bets on specific numbers. But remember, roulette is all about playing the long game. Over hundreds of rounds, the tiny difference in probability will slowly but surely tilt the odds in your favour.

#  The Odds are Against You When the Roulette Wheel Fails to Deliver a Dozen

The odds are never in your favor at a casino, but when the roulette wheel refuses to deliver a dozen, they become downright stacked against you. The house edge on European roulette is 2.7%, meaning that for every $100 you bet, you can expect to lose $2.70 on average. However, when the wheel fails to produce twelve consecutive reds or blacks, that house edge jumps to 11.1%. In other words, for every $100 you bet, you can expect to lose $11.10 on average!

There's no surefire way to take advantage of this situation and beat the casino, but there are a few things you can do to minimize your losses. First and foremost, avoid betting on individual numbers if the wheel has not delivered a dozen in a row. The odds of hitting any given number are 18-to-1, so your chances of winning are slim even under ideal conditions. Instead, focus on betting on outside bets like red or black, odd or even, or low (1-18) or high (19-36) numbers. These bets offer better odds and give you a better chance of walking away from the table with some money in your pocket.

Another thing to keep in mind when the roulette wheel refuses to deliver a dozen is that it's not necessarily indicative of future results. Just because the last twelve spins have all come up black or red doesn't mean that the next spin will too. Be patient and wait for an opportunity that presents itself before placing your bet.

At the end of the day, remember that casinos always have the edge over players. When the roulette wheel refuses to deliver a dozen, that edge becomes even more pronounced – so be smart about where you place your bets and know when to walk away from the table.

#  Roulette Strategy Fails When the Ball Falls on All Red or All Black

The Martingale strategy is a popular betting system for roulette that dictates doubling your bet after every loss. This system is intended to recover losses and make a profit, but it fails in the long run when the ball falls on all red or all black.

When you play roulette, you have a fifty-fifty chance of winning on any given spin. So, with the Martingale strategy, you would double your bet after each loss in order to cover your losses and win your original bet back. But if the ball falls on all red or black, you lose not only your original bet but also all of your subsequent bets. This can quickly lead to large losses, especially if you are using a high betting limit.

The Martingale strategy may work in the short term, but it will eventually result in a net loss. So if you’re looking to make money playing roulette, it’s best to find another strategy.

#  Busted! You Lose $1,200 When 12 Never Appears at Roulette

The outcome of a spin of a roulette wheel is always random. This means that any time you roll the dice, there’s an equal chance that any number will come up. So, when you play roulette and put your chips down on black, you should theoretically have an equal chance of winning as losing.

However, casinos have built-in house edges that ensure they always make money in the long run – even if players repeatedly win in the short term. In fact, one study found that over a million spins at a European roulette table, black only came up 19 times more often than red. This may seem like a lot, but with 36 numbers on the wheel, the odds of any given number coming up are just 1 in 36.

This means that if you put all your chips on black and it doesn’t come up on the next spin, you’ve lost not just your bet but also the chips you put down as well. In fact, over time casino gamblers can expect to lose around 5% of their total bankroll. So if you’re playing with $1,000, you can expect to lose around $50 in the long run.

However, there are ways to reduce these odds and improve your chances of winning. One simple strategy is to bet on multiple colors instead of just black or red – this way even if one color doesn’t come up, you still have a chance of winning with the other color. You can also try betting on specific numbers or groups of numbers to increase your chances even further.

Whichever strategy you choose, remember that roulette is a game of chance and no amount of strategizing will change the odds in your favor. So be patient and keep playing – eventually you’ll walk away a winner!

#  Getting a Dozen at Roulette Seems Like a Sure Thing, But....

Most people think that if they get a dozen at roulette, they’re sure to win. But that’s not always the case! In fact, getting a dozen is only a little better than random chance – you have about a 31% chance of winning, while the house has a 39% edge.

So why do people keep betting on dozen? It seems like it should be an easy win, but in reality it’s not. The thing that attracts people to dozen is its high payout – 12 to 1. But when you compare that payout to the risk involved, it really isn’t worth it.

If you want to make money at roulette, you’re better off sticking to simpler bets like betting on red or black, or even betting on a single number. These bets have lower payouts (2 to 1 for red or black, and 35 to 1 for single number), but they also have much lower odds of losing. In the long run, you’re more likely to come out ahead by playing these simpler bets.
