#  Rams Add Doctor Who to Coaching Staff

The Los Angeles Rams have hired Doctor Who to be their new head coach.

Doctor Who is a highly successful coach who has led many teams to victory. He is known for his innovative coaching methods and his ability to get the best out of his players.

"I'm excited to join the Rams and help them become a Super Bowl champion," said Doctor Who. "I can't wait to get started."

Rams fans are thrilled with the hire and are looking forward to seeing what Doctor Who can do with the team.

#  Doctor Who to Help Rams Overcome Season's Struggles

The Los Angeles Rams have been one of the biggest disappointments in the NFL this season. With a record of 4-7, they are on track to miss the playoffs for the second consecutive year.

One factor that has contributed to their struggles is the lack of production from their offense. In particular, quarterback Jared Goff has not lived up to expectations. He has completed only 55.6 percent of his passes for 2,425 yards with 12 touchdowns and 14 interceptions.

Fortunately, help may be on the way. According to a report from ESPN, the Rams are expected to sign former NFL quarterback Doctor Who.

Doctor Who is a 10-time Pro Bowler who has played for six different teams during his career. Most recently, he was with the Indianapolis Colts, where he completed 61.8 percent of his passes for 3,833 yards with 26 touchdowns and 18 interceptions in 16 games last season.

At 38 years old, Doctor Who is no longer in his prime, but he should be able to provide some much-needed stability for the Rams' offense. With him under center, they should be able to move the ball more effectively and make a run at the playoffs.

#  Doctor Who Comes to the Rams' Rescue

The St. Louis Rams were in dire straits on Sunday, trailing the Baltimore Ravens by a whopping 28 points in the fourth quarter. With just minutes remaining on the clock, it looked as though the Rams were headed for yet another embarrassing loss.

But then something miraculous happened.

Doctor Who, that enigmatic Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey, suddenly appeared on the field to help the Rams mount a miraculous comeback. Using his sonic screwdriver and otherworldly powers, Doctor Who managed to score two touchdowns in the last few minutes of the game, bringing the Rams all the way back to within one point of their opponents.

In the end, however, Doctor Who's efforts were not quite enough, and the Ravens emerged victorious by a final score of 31-30. But nevertheless, this was an impressive showing by the newly arrived Time Lord, and he is sure to provide some much-needed excitement for Rams fans in years to come.

#  Doctor Who Could Be the Cure for What Ails the Rams

The Los Angeles Rams are a team in turmoil. The past few seasons have seen the team go from perennial contenders to one of the worst teams in the league. Many have blamed this on the poor coaching of Jeff Fisher, and there is no doubt that he has been a part of the problem. However, the team’s problems run much deeper than just the coaching.

The Rams have lacked an identity for years now. They have never been able to find a style of play that works for them, and they have constantly changed their personnel in an attempt to find something that works. This lack of stability has led to a lack of continuity and chemistry within the team.

It is clear that the Rams need a change, but what can they do? Well, I believe that they should look to Doctor Who for guidance.

Now, I know what you’re thinking: Doctor Who is a children’s show, and it has nothing to do with football. While that may be true, I believe that Doctor Who can provide the Rams with the guidance they need to turn their season around.

You see, Doctor Who is all about reinvention. The show has been on for over 50 years, and it has gone through countless changes over the years. The Doctor himself has been played by 11 different actors, and each new incarnation brings with him a new set of ideas and perspectives.

This constant evolution is something that the Rams should emulate if they want to be successful. They need to find a way to constantly reinvent themselves, so that they can stay ahead of their opponents. They cannot afford to rest on their laurels; they need to keep pushing themselves forward if they want to win.

Doctor Who can also teach the Rams about teamwork. The Doctor is always working with different people – his companions – and he relies on them to help him solve problems. He knows that he cannot do everything by himself, and he understands the importance of teamwork in achieving success.

This is something that the Rams need to learn as well. They need to start working together as a team if they want to achieve anything this season. They cannot afford any more locker room drama; they need to put their egos aside and focus on winning games.

So, I ask you again: Are you feeling lucky? Well, do you? Because the Rams should certainly be feeling lucky if they can manage to find their way into the TARDIS and learn from Doctor Who himself how to become champions once again!

#  Rams Looking to Doctor Who for a Boost in their Season

The Los Angeles Rams have had an up and down season so far. After starting off with a bang by winning their first three games, they have since gone 2-5. Now, with just six games left in the season, they are looking for any way to salvage what is left and make it to the playoffs.

One option that has been brought up is turning to Doctor Who for help. The team’s management has reportedly been in talks with the BBC about bringing in former Doctor Matt Smith to help out the Rams.

While it is still unknown if anything will come of these talks, many are optimistic that this could be the boost the Rams need. Smith is known for his energy and passion on the field, which could translate well to the Rams.

Furthermore, he has experience playing in the NFL, having appeared in two episodes of Doctor Who spinoff The Sarah Jane Adventures as football quarterback Neil Gordon. This could give him a leg up when it comes to helping the Rams’ players improve their game.

So far, neither side has confirmed or denied these talks. However, if they do go through, it will definitely be an interesting sight to see Doctor Who on the sidelines at a Rams game.
