#  What is the history of Where Sweetspot N.V. Casinos,Croatia,Dickens? 

Where Sweetspot N.V. Casinos,Croatia,Dickens, often abbreviated as WSSNVC, is a casino company that was founded in 1998 by John McGrath and his business partner. The casino company has its base in Zagreb, Croatia and owns several casinos in the country as well as one in Dickens, a small town near London.

The origins of the company can be traced back to McGrath’s time spent working in the entertainment industry in Las Vegas. He had the idea to open a casino in the city of Zagreb and pitched it to his then business partner. The two of them went on to open their first casino in 1998 and have since grown the company into what it is today.

While WSSNVC started out as a Croatian casino company, it has since expanded into other markets. In 2007, the company opened its first casino outside of Croatia, in Dickens near London. This was followed by additional casinos in Poland (2011), Bulgaria (2012), Romania (2013), and Slovakia (2016).

The company has faced its share of challenges over the years. In 2012, its Polish casino was shut down due to allegations of money laundering. And more recently, its Slovakian casino has come under fire for suspected ties to organized crime. However, WSSNVC has maintained that it operates within all applicable laws and regulations in each of the countries where it has a presence. 

Looking forward, WSSNVC plans to continue expanding its operations into new markets.
