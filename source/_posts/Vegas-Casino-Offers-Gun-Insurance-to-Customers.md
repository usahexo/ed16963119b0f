#  Vegas Casino Offers Gun Insurance to Customers

The Las Vegas casino, MGM, has announced that it will offer firearms insurance to its customers. The insurance, which will be provided by the insurer Chubb, will cover any legal costs related to gun incidents.

MGM has faced pressure to adopt gun safety measures since the mass shooting at one of its properties in October 2017. In response, the company has announced a number of new measures, including the firearms insurance policy.

The policy will cover any legal costs incurred by customers who are involved in shootings at MGM properties. It will also provide financial assistance to the victims’ families.

A spokesperson for MGM said that the policy was offered in response to customer demand. He added that the company hopes that it will help to make its properties safer for guests and employees.

The president of Chubb North America, Evan Greenberg, said that the company was proud to partner with MGM on this initiative. He added that the policy would help protect innocent people who have been affected by gun violence.

#  Is the Virgin River Casino's Gun Policy a Scam?

The Virgin River Casino is a casino and hotel located in Mesquite, Nevada. It is operated by the Stations Casino chain. In March of 2018, the Virgin River Casino announced a new gun policy that would forbid concealed firearms from being brought into the casino. This policy was met with criticism from many people, including the Nevada Firearms Coalition, who accused the casino of instituting a "gun scam."

Under the new policy, guns are still allowed in the parking lot and on the premises of the hotel, but are not allowed in the casino itself. This has led to criticisms that the policy is ineffective, as it does nothing to prevent criminals from carrying guns into the casino. Others have argued that the policy is simply a way for the casino to avoid liability in case of an incident.

Virgin River Casino has responded to these criticisms by stating that their primary concern is safety, and that they do not want their guests to feel unsafe while gambling or enjoying dinner at one of their restaurants. They also argue that their policy is consistent with other casinos in Nevada.

So far, there has been no evidence that Virgin River Casino's gun policy is a scam. However, it is clear that this policy has been met with criticism from many people who feel that it is ineffective and serves only to protect the casino from liability.

#  What is the Virgin River Casino's Gun Insurance Policy?

The Virgin River Casino in Mesquite, Nevada, has been in operation since June 1, 2001. It is owned and operated by the St. George, Utah-based Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In light of the recent mass shooting in Las Vegas, many people are wondering what the Virgin River Casino's gun insurance policy is.

The short answer is that the Virgin River Casino does not have a gun insurance policy. In a statement released on October 3, 2017, the casino said, "Virgin River does not nor has it ever had a policy that prohibits guests from bringing firearms onto our property."

#  Casino offers insurance against gun accidents

As the nation continues to reel from a seemingly endless series of mass shootings, one casino has taken the proactive step of offering insurance against gun accidents. The policy, which is being offered by the Casino of the Rockies in Black Hawk, Colorado, provides up to $1 million in coverage for victims of accidental shootings.

“With all the gun violence happening in our country right now, we felt like it was our responsibility to do something to help protect our guests and employees,” said casino spokesperson Chelsea Hebert. “We’re not saying that guns are bad or that people shouldn’t be allowed to own them – we just want to provide some peace of mind for those who might be worried about being caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.”

The insurance policy is available to any customer or employee who visits or works at the casino. Coverage is provided for up to $1 million per incident, with no deductible. According to Hebert, the casino has already received a number of inquiries from people interested in buying coverage.

This is not the first time that a casino has offered insurance against gun accidents. In fact, it is becoming increasingly common as more and more businesses feel the need to protect themselves against potential liability issues. Several states have already passed laws requiring businesses to provide such coverage if they allow customers to carry firearms on their property.

While some people may see this as a sign that America is becoming too dangerous, others see it as a necessary step in protecting ourselves from gun violence. What do you think?
