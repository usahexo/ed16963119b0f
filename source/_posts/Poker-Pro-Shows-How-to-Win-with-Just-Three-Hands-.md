#  Poker Pro Shows How to Win with Just Three Hands 

In poker, as in life, it’s always best to have a plan.

When faced with difficult decisions, poker pros often fall back on tried-and-true strategies that have worked for them in the past. But sometimes even the best-laid plans go awry, and players must improvise in order to salvage their chips.

In a Sit and Go tournament last month, Ali Imsirovic showed how to win with just three hands. Imsirovic is a professional poker player who has won more than $1.5 million in live tournaments.

The final hand of the tournament came down to Imsirovic and two other players. All three had about the same number of chips. Imsirovic decided to bluff his way to victory by betting all his chips with [Ace high](https://pokerhand.org/?a=kQsds). His opponents folded, and Imsirovic took down the tournament.

This isn’t the first time Imsirovic has pulled off an amazing bluff. In a live poker tournament last year, he bluffed his way into winning first place and $183,000.

What can we learn from Imsirovic’s strategy? First of all, never give up when you’re behind. Even if you only have a few chips left, try to make a big move and take your opponents by surprise. Also, know when to fold – if your hand isn’t strong enough to win the pot outright, it might be better to fold and save your chips for another hand.

Lastly, be prepared to bet all your chips when the opportunity arises. A big bet can sometimes scare your opponents into folding, even if they have a better hand than you do.

#  Baccarat: Another Game that Can be Played with Five Cards 

In baccarat, a player has the option to bet on either "Player" or "Banker". The goal of the game is to have a hand total closest to 9. If both player and banker have the same number value on their hands, the game is a "push" and no one wins or loses money.

Aces are worth 1 point, 2s through 9s are worth their face value, and 10s and face cards are each worth 0 points.

Baccarat can be played with either five or six cards. With five cards, the player must use two of them for their hand total. With six cards, the player can use any three of them for their hand total. The same rules for drawing apply; if the player's hand total is 8 or 9, they must stand; if the player's hand total is less than 5, they must draw one card; and if the player's hand total is 5 or 6, they must draw two cards.
