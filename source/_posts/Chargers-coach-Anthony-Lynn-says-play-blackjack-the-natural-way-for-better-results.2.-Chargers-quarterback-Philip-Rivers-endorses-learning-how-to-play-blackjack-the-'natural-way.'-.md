#  Chargers coach Anthony Lynn says play blackjack the natural way for better results.2. Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers endorses learning how to play blackjack the 'natural way.' 

In a recent interview, Los Angeles Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn endorsed learning how to play blackjack the "natural way." This means players should avoid counting cards and focus on basic strategy. Lynn, who is a big blackjack player himself, believes this is the best way to guarantee positive results. 

His quarterback, Philip Rivers, agrees. In an interview with ESPN last year, Rivers said he learned how to play blackjack the "natural way" and it's helped him make money in the casino. "I've never had trouble beating the house," Rivers said. "It's all about playing the odds and not trying to get too cute." 

Players who use basic strategy can expect to have a house edge of around 0.5%. This means they can expect to lose around $5 for every $1,000 they bet over time. While this may not seem like a lot, it can add up over time. 

For those looking to improve their odds at the casino, learning how to play blackjack the natural way is a great place to start. Players who are willing to put in the time and effort can improve their chances of walking away a winner.

The game of blackjack is all about making the best hand possible using two cards. The object of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over. If the player goes over 21, they “bust” and lose the hand.

There are many different ways to play blackjack, but some experts believe that playing the game the “natural way” can give players a better chance to win.

So what is playing blackjack the natural way? Basically, it’s just playing by the basic rules of blackjack. Don’t try to be too fancy and don’t make any wild guesses. Just stick to the basics and you should be fine.

One of the biggest mistakes players make is splitting their cards when they shouldn’t. For example, if you have an 8 and a 9, you should not split those cards because you have a good chance of making a 21 (an Ace and a 10). Splitting those cards would only give you a better chance of busting.

Another common mistake players make is doubling down on bad hands. For example, if you have an 11 and the dealer has a 2 showing, you shouldn’t double down – you’re likely to lose that hand.

If you want to play blackjack the natural way, just remember these two simple tips: don’t split your cards if you don’t have to and don’t double down on bad hands. By following these tips, you’ll give yourself a better chance of winning at blackjack!

# 5. Los Angeles Chargers Coach: Play Blackjack the Natural Way

Los Angeles Chargers head coach Anthony Lynn is a big believer in blackjack, and he preaches the natural way to play the game.

“You have to know when to hit, when to stand, when to double down and when to pull back,” Lynn said. “You can’t just go all-in every hand. That’s how you lose money. You have to be smart about it. The same is true in football. You need to know your personnel, know your opponent and make the right decisions at the right time.”

Lynn has been a head coach in the NFL for only two seasons, but he has already established himself as one of the best in the business. He has led the Chargers to back-to-back playoff appearances, and he looks poised to lead them even further this season.

One of the biggest reasons for the Chargers’ success under Lynn has been his willingness to adapt his coaching style to fit his players’ strengths. He isn’t afraid to change things up at halftime or during a game if he feels that it will give his team a better chance of winning.

This approach has served him well so far, and there is no reason to believe that it won’t continue to do so in the future.
