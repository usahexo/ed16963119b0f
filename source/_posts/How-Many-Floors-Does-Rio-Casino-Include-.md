The Rio Casino Resort is a 52-floor, 360-foot (110 m) tall hotel and casino located in Paradise, Nevada on the Las Vegas Strip. It is owned and operated by Caesars Entertainment Corporation. The Rio was the first all suite resort on the Las Vegas Strip.

The tower was originally built in 1990 as the Silverbird casino by Al Adelson and his son, Bob, for $275 million. The project was sold in 1995 to Steve Wynn for $594 million. In 1997, after Steve Wynn had opened the Bellagio, he sold the Silverbird to MGM Grand Hotels, who then changed the name to MGM Grand Hotel and Casino. They closed the hotel in 2000 for a major renovation and expansion which added 932 rooms making it the largest hotel in Nevada with 5,005 rooms. The renovation cost $700 million and was designed by Marnell Corrao Associates. The expansion doubled the size of the complex to 2,567,000 square feet (240,000 m2).

The tower was again renamed as part of an agreement with nearby New York-New York Hotel & Casino which share similar themes and colors. The Rio became known as the "Rio All Suite Hotel and Casino". In 2007, they removed all of the casino's table games except craps and roulette, which are both less popular than slot machines.

In 2013, a $75 million renovation began that includes a new Race & Sports Book and high-limit gaming area.
